** Filaments in L-diverted mode at different densities
   List of signals to be considered for shot 81473 and 81477, 81486, 81490. 
   Remember the all signal is of the form Subsystem/node:subnode

   | Name | Pulse file | Subsystem | Node     | Subnode |

   | mov  | jpf        | de        | y3-cdcb  | <mov    |
   
   Signals can be read from IDL using jpfget routine
   jpfget,node='subsystem/node:subnode',pulno=#,data=data,tvec=tvec,title=title,unit=unit,ier=ierjet
   How can I infer if they are inward or outward shifted?
   I've found the signal for the centroid of the plasma but does not seem to vary very much
*** Analysis to be included in the main program [4/5]
   - [X] Profiles
   - [X] scaling of the pdf
   - [X] fit of the exponential stretched function
   - [X] Profile of the packing fraction
   - [ ] Intermittent structures also including parallel mach number

*** Notes on DALPHA channels    
    - We can have different channels for Dalpha, berillium and Carbon which are
      + PPF/EDG8/DAI for inner dalpha oscillations 10 LOS
      + PPF/EDG8/DAO for outer dalpha oscillations 10 LOS
      + PPF/EDG8/BEI for berillium II inner divertor oscillations 10 LOS
      + PPF/EDG8/BEO for berillum II outer divertor oscillations 10 LOS
      
*** Notes on FAST ECE data
    There exhists data which are collected with fast
    acquisition. These are JPF/DE/KK3F-TE:001-096
*** TODO [0/3]
- [ ] Determine shotlist from webpage and global analysis on the
  scaling of the frequency with the pedestal temperature
- [ ] Verify consistency of Langmuir probes and eventually of triple
  probes if available to see if M-mode is seen also from that. Try
  floating potential map to see if oscillations is so local that they
  can be seen from probes
- [ ] Verify presence/absence on the Ni-seeding experiments
*** Observation
- NBI shots different with respect to ICRH shots. The latter always
  start with divertor oscilallations and mode is found to increase in
  time and then remain almost stationary without any dependence from
  Te. Generally start with inner/outer out of phase and when Inner
  drop and Wdia increase they become in phase
- No divertor oscillations before NBI shots. Among the database
  actually these are different

Observation and planning activities
1. # Shot 80951 with density ramp and variation of M-mode frequency
2. GAM should exhibits a q-dependence. Why?
3. Reference to Schmitz predator-prey mode
4. Look at dependence on density and eventually on dependence on pressure
5. Automatically find KK3F channel with maximum correlation
6. Look at Ohmic M-Mode # 82635

Se consideriamo il PRL di Loarte o meglio in generale la condizione di
Detachment e' raggiunta ad alta densita, quando la temperatura ai
plate e' molto bassa dell'ordine di alcuni eV, CX collisions become
important, remove momemntum and plasma can recombine before reaching
the target.

  

*** Probe system on the divertor of JET
    Talk to S. Marsen, responsible office for Divertor and Target probes.
    From Pulses from january 2012 there exhists triple probes which
    can be accessed as raw data  from JPF files Diagnostic DE, Y4-TRI
    in particular we have probe system (A,B,C) with A and B as double
    probe and C as floating potential. They can be accessed as:
    - JPF/DE/Y4-TRI1:#probe for the current of the double probe
    - JPF/DE/YA-TRV2:#probe for the voltage of the double probe
    - JPF/DE/Y4-TRV3:#probe for the floating potential
    In particular on Tile 5 probe 15,16,19,20,21,24 are triple probes
    (actually presently on <2012-03-02 Fri> 19,21,24). on tile 3 probe
    5 and 8

*** Fluctuations from Reflectometry
    - Talk to A. Sirenelli for the measurements which can be done on fluctuations

** Pellet Pacing experiment
   Sessione del 29 Febbraio 2012 da 82435 a 82449

** Washboard Modes
*** Lettura P. Smeulders, PPCF 41 1303 (1999)


** Summary of the work performed
Analysis of electrostatic fluctuations from RLP during L mode, ohmic discharges at different values of n/nG: determination of the difference in statistical features and typical pattern of blob observed. Analysis toroidal flow breaking in EFCC experiments with different FCC current and different gas injection rate. Analysis of Langmuir probe and D alpha signals during the so called M-Mode phase. Identification of sort o precursors in divertor oscillations and analysis of the scaling of the mode frequency with density and temperature.
* JET C31 Campaign 2013
** List of interesting experimental proposals
- M13-04 Impact of triangularity on pedestal and confinement
- M13-13 Power width, ELM heat load and pedestal scaling
- M13-23 L-H transition studues
- B13-17 Power fall-off width scaling in L-mode and evolution accross
  L-H and H-L transitions
- B13-19 Investigation of M-mode

** Competences
- EPS Edge Pedestal, ELM and H-Mode expert
- Probes + Quartz PQMB
- TRB Turbulence analysis expert

** Plan:
- M-Mode and divertor oscillation studies
- Role of SOL in LH-HL transition through the use of RLP
- Modification of SOL flow and SOL turbulence properties during ELM
  controlled experiments, Kiks/ECFF
- Studies difference in SOL properties (Dalpha, probes, floating
  potential, saturation current) during LH transition also at
  different divertor geometry
- 

** Skype meeting w E. Solano
- Check the density dependence of the frequency in particular for
  shot # 80951
- Share the code for following the mode structure
- R. Cohelo started a new analysis to check the phase difference in
  particular between B_p and \nabla p in order to check if a phase
  transition occur
- Check the mode frequency scaling with Bt
- Power threshold for the M-Mode seems to be similar to that of L-H transition
- How to check if we are in a high recycling regime (?)
** M-Mode presentation at the TF meeting
<2013-03-07 Thu>
- Slide 8: The present data set consists of approximately 45
  discharges almost entirely at 2.4 T with just few pulses at higher
  and lower toroidal magnetic field. We have observed M-Mode primarly
  in ICRH plasmas but we also have examples a low-density NBI and
  cases in Ohmic state
- Slide 9: As Emilia told you M-Mode is observed both in pedestal plasma
  parameter and in SOL signals. Often in ICRH plasmas M-Mode is
  preceed by the so-called Divertor Oscillations, which have also been
  seen in the past in Carbon wall. From the experimental point of
  view, DO can be seen as oscillations at few tens of Hz in the D-alpha signals, with
  inner-outer channel in counter-phase as can be deduced by
  cross-correlation analysis between inner and outer Dalpha
  signals. After a final drop in the Dalpha M-Mode start and its
  frequency increases
** M-Mode presentation at TF and JET meeting
- [ ] Define the team member
- [ ] Prepare two different pulse lists one in the case ICRH only is
  available one with also NBI
- [ ] Define the diagnostic list: Li-Beam is mandatory, ICRH is
  incompatible with ICRH operation
- [ ] See last campaign pulse list
- [ ] If NBI available 1MW NBI power for diagnostics could also give
  the additional power to perform a slow L-M-H transition

*** Writing IDL PPF files
- Nella vecchia versione il modo semplice era questo:
  IDL> ppfopn,shot=20981,ppfuid='JETUID',ierr=ierr 
  IDL> ppfwri,shot=20981,dda='test',dtype='sig',data=datarr,t=time,ierr=ierr
  IDL> ppfclo,shot=20981,ierr=ierr
- Nella nuova versione ragionevolmente dovrebbe essere questo
  IDL> idlppf_ppfuid, userid=nvian, rw=w
  IDL> idlppf_ppfopn, shot=shot, seq=tseq, lun=lun, nrmax=nrmax,
  indat=indat, comment=comment, ierr=ierr. Qui usi solo  lo shot penso
  IDL> idlppf_ppfsetdevice, device=device (qui dai il nome del
  device). Anche se non sono sicuro sia necessario
  IDL> idlppf_ppfwri, shot=shot, dda=dda, dtype=dtype, data=data, x=x, t=t, irdat=irdat, $
                 ihdat=ihdat, iwdat=iwdat, ierr=ierr. Qui servono shot,dda,dtype,data,x,t
