*** Nave
 The presence of a magnetic ripple breaks the toroidal symmetry so
 that the motion of individual particles may lead to nonambipolar
 transport that can affect the plasma rotation through the
 neoclassical toroidal viscosity. During NBI magnetic ripple has an
 effect as the ripple transport of fast ions induces edge
 counterrotation in plasmas. Experiment in JET performed in Ohmic
 plasmas where CXRS angular frequency consistent with MHD propagation
 (*different from our cases*). Results is that in the core in the core
 where is naturally countercorrent, toroidal rotation becomes more
 negative whereas at the edge corotation decreases and for ripple of 1
 % it becomes counter-current. Theory suggest that toroidal field
 ripple, by breacking toroidal simmetry, induces radial particle
 diffusion which could be different for ions and electrons. This
 non-ambipolar transport gives rise to a charge separation that
 relaxes the radial electric field and the toroidal rotation toward a
 steady state where particle flux is ambipolar. In TORE SUPRA
 analogous experiment reveal the consequence of too high ripple in
 term of magnetic well.
*** Garofalo
- Esiste un neoclassical offset toroidal rotation associated with a
  Torque T_{NR}\propto (V_{\phi}-V_{\phi}^0) driven by static
  nonresonant fields. Comparable to ion diamagnetic drift but opposite direction
- Existence of offset toroidal rotation proven by looking the
  \omega_{\phi} vs torque density (zero torque --> 50 km/s)
- Modification of flow profile modifies \omega_E = E_r/RB_{\theta} and
  lead to confinement improvement consistent with microturbulence stabilization
- V_{\phi}^{0,NC} \approx (k_c/Z_ieB_{\theta})(\partial
  T_i/\partial_r) with k_c depending on collisionality
*** Callen IAEA
- Si scrive una equazione di trasporto del toroidal angular momentum
  density con diversi contributi 
  \frac{\partial L}{\partial t} = NTV + resonant FE + cl,neo,pal +
  Reynolds + momentum source
  - *Collision-induced toroidal torque* Proporzionale alla
    perturbazione normalizzata ed alla differenza fra flow toroidale e NC toroidal
    rotation offset (quest'ultimo proporzionale al gradiente di
    temperatura ionica). C'e' una costante chiamata toroidal viscosity
    frequency che dipende dal regime collisionale. The presence of 3D
    fields introduce radial drifts of the center of trapped-ion banana
    orbits with a drift velocity proportional to the normalized perturbation.

*** Spong
Troppo specifico. Tratta di DKES e PENTA. Interessante secondo me e'
la frase per cui in stellarator ions and electron loss rates are not
automatically ambipolar leading to electric field formation.
** DONE Presentation outline
CLOSED: [2011-02-04 Fri 14:50]
1. Motivation and outline
2. Core measurements: passive from BV and CV (figura del 1D impurity
   transport model). Toroidal and Poloidal rotation profile. Hints we
   have intrinsic toroidal rotation
3. Core measurements: Helical pattern determined through the
   application of non-zero reference for most internal mode with
   convective cell (fig poloidal cross section)
4. Shearing rate (location around the barrier with \omega_E \approx \gamma_{MT}) dependence on amplitude of the perturbation. Confronto
   con Nave PRL fig 2(b) (although in that case NR perturbation are
   applied and we are dealing with toroidal rotation). Different behavior core (naturally counter-current and
   becomes more negative) to edge (naturally co-rotation decreases and
   becomes even counter-current). Simmetry breaking cause non-ambipolar
   electron-ion diffusion and consequently E_r builds up to 
5. Comparison with theory MHD (but not always inconsistent) we should
   consider some other things
6. How we locate in the general momentum framework which is now aware
   of 3D effect. Angular toroidal momentum model with 3D field from Callen
   1. low n non-resonant \delta b torques (fig. garofalo)
   2. medium n ripple (richiama Nave)
   3. low n resonant \delta b torque --> plasma breaking (fig 8
      Callen) or in general Tsang (PoF 19 1976) magnetic field ripple
      lead to a non ambipolar ion flux (--> E_r)
   4. effects which comes from reynolds stress: which is divided in
      toroidal reynolds stress, convective flux and residual stress
      which convect part of the heat flux into toroidal flow (Diamond,
      Gurcan)
   5. Toroidal and poloidal rotation are linked together (see Callen)
   6. Beware this is done from a perturbed 2D equilibrium of a
      tokamak.
7. Stellarator (Spong & Helander & Ida --> we should deal with
   turbuelence and zonal flow). Rimanda al talk di Marco Gobbin
8. Edge: parallel flow inversion (rifare figura) and toroidal flow ripple
9. Edge: estimate of the dynamo pattern--> estimate of the dynamo
   field ( hints on the possibility to infer j_{\parallel} )
10. Comparison with theory: pure MHD (with no pressure and zero-velocity
    at the edge) consistent in the core but not at the edge

** Remote meeting with V.Naulin, J.J.Rasmussen and S.Costea
 - Check the modification of edge \beta in between mitigated, uneffective
   magnetic perturbation and mitigated phase
 - Ask if using high flux probe similar observation resulted on ion
   saturation current signal
 - Check if Doppler reflectometer observe a similar mode on flow
   during the mitigated phase. Beware that the different density could
   caouse a different loss of thermal particle and a consequent
   different torque
 - Check if available the spatial phase relation between the
   perturbation and the manipulator
 - It is possible to execute vacuum shots with manipulator to see if
   it is possible to reconstruct vacuum RMP perturbation?

*3D effects on plasma rotation: comparative studies in Tokamak and
Reversed Field Pinches*
RFX-mod is a flexible device which offers the valuable possibility to
operate both as a Reversed Field Pinch with plasma current up to 2MA
or as a low-current ohmic circular tokamak. Furthermore it is equipped
with a state-of-the-art system for MHD control with 192 indipendent
coils (48 toroidal x 4 poloidal position), covering the entire torus, 
indipendently powered. The system is equipped with a full set of flow
measurements, including multi-cord passive spectroscopy system, plus
edge measurements for the estimate of the various components of the
flows at the edge in low-current discharges. The probe system, which
combines electrostatic and magnetic fluctuations has been conceived in
order to provide information also on turbulence induced perpendicular
flow component, including Reynolds and Maxwell stress tensor,
convective turbulent flow measurement with an high spatial and
temporal resolution. Moreover a full toroidal array of electrostatic
pins embedded in the first wall offers the possibility to obtain the
full toroidal map of the toroidal flow at the edge.
Experimental results already obtained both in tokamak and RFPs have
demonstrated a strong correlation between natural and stimulated
non-axysimmetric magnetic field and plasma flow. Indeed MHD flow
associated to helical deformation in RFPs revealed a strong
correlation with poloidal flow [Piovesan et al]. At the edge the small
residual helical ripple modulates the edge radial electric field
through a modification of the rate of ion-to-electron diffusion rate
determining a perpendicular flow with the same helicity of the
dominant perturbation [Vianello IAEA 2012]. Also tokamak investigation 
with the application
of an $n=2$ perturbation has shown effects on the toroidal flow which
has been interpreted as a combination effect between NTV and
stochastic dominated flow. The activity proposed represents an
extension of the present partial experimental observation. Experiment
and analysis are proposed on the following topics:
 1. MP experiment in Ohmic tokamak: studies of the effects  of magnetic
    pertubation both resonant and non resonant both on the toroidal and
    poloidal components of the flow. The analysis is done in terms of
    amplitude, rotation frequency and helicity of the perturbation. Core
    measurements obtained from passive spectroscopy will be combined with
    edge information obtained from probe which will offer the possibility
    to have information both on toroidal flow and on the poloidal one,
    the latter with the added values of decomposing all the information
    related to turbulence induced perpendicual flow. Interpretation will
    be corroborated both with simple 1D momentum diffusivity equation
    plus hamiltonian code for the analysis of the edge radial electric field
2.  MP experiment in RFPs: studies of the effects of magnetic
    perturbation, both resonant and non resonant on parallel and
    perpendicular flow in RFPs. Focus will be devoted on collisionality
    dependece, and on the determination of the various components of
    the stress tensor, already measured in Multiple Helicity low
    current regime [Vianello PRL2005] at the edge by means of 
    insertable probe. Effects
    of amplitude, rotation frequency and helicity will be analyzed
    focusing the attention on the spatial distribution of the various
    quantities with respect to the magnetic field perturbation

***** Experiment Scope:
***** Goals
     Experiments with rotating magnetic perturbation in DIII-D and TEXTOR have revealed
     a complex response of edge pedestal and scrape off layer in dependence of the applied
     periodicity
     and phase. This has been for example shown in the modulation of edge density in DIII-D
     [ Moyer, R. A. et al.,  Nuclear Fusion 52, 123019 (2012)] or in the DED experiment in
     Textor [Stoschus, H. et al. Nuclear Fusion 53, 012001 (2013)]. This actually resembles
     the reported effects of edge magnetic perturbation in helical plasmas in RFP 
     [Vianello, N. et al., Nuclear Fusion 53, 073025 (2013)] or in stellarators
     [Kobayashi, M. et al. Nuclear Fusion 53, 093032 (2013)]. 
     Initial observation of Electric field
     modification in presence of MP has been reported also in
     AUG [H.W.Muller, JNM 438, S64 2013, EPS 2013]. 
     In the case of RFP, the most
     important observation is the response of the Electric field caused by the
     different behavior of electron and ion to the O and X point of magnetic perturbation, or
     generally to the phase of the perturbation. The behavior of
     the electric field has been succesfully modeled in terms of ambipolar electric field
     both in RFP [Spizzo, G. et al. Nuclear Fusion 52, 054015 (2012)]
     and in tokamak [G.Ciaccio, et al, Nuclear Fusion submitted]
     with the help of guiding centre code ORBIT. The proposal aims to:
     1. Determine the Electric Field response to a rotating magnetic perturbation in the pedestal and
	Scrape Off Layer region. In particular we would like to compare both parity and reconstruct the
	profile as a function of the phase relative to the perturbation
     2. Determine the difference (if any) in the Ion and Electron profile modification in the pedestal
	region, also related to the relative phase of the perturbation
     3. Determine rotating perturbation can induce a density pump-out,  up to now not observed in
	AUG RMP experiments
     4. Compare the results with guiding centre code ORBIT, which has been succesfully applied
	in both tokamak/RFP helical perturbation
     5. Determine turbulence modification in rotating RMP in pedestal/SOL in relation with the phase of the Mode. Include
	studies of poloidal flow from GPI cross-correlation analysis
	[see for example M. Agostini et al Nuclear Fusion 51, 053020 (2011).]

	 non mitigated discharges
      2. Vary rotation frequency in order to optimize diagnostic requirements (E_r from Doppler
	 reflectometry),  Ti (from CXRS),  Te (Thomson & 2D ECE),  En (Thomson & Li-Beam)
      3. Eventually combination of ICRH/ECRH heating scheme in order to observe possible variation from
	 ion to electron dominated heating scheme

	 where available and interpretation of E_r ripple on the basis of ambipolar diffusion
***** Deliverables
      In the framework of the requirements for Headline 1.2 the proposal will focus on:
      - Determine the electric field response to resonant/non resonant perturbation and eventual
	asymmetry
      - Determine the difference in electron/ion response to a magnetic perturbation, correlating
	this difference with the observed magnetic field

***** Experiment Scope:
***** Goals
      Aim of the proposal is a complete characterization of the effect of MP (magnetic perturbation,  both
      Resonant Magnetic Perturbation (RMP) and Non Resonant Magnetic Perturbation (nRMP)) on the
      electromagnetic characteristics of
      filaments observed during ELM
      [see N.Vianello et al,  PRL 106, 125002 (2011)] or with Solitary Magnetic Perturbation
      [see R. Wenninger, NF 52,  114025 (2012)].
      Investigation will be based on measurements with insertable probe (Innsbruk-Padua probe),
      which provides information on both
      electrostatic and magnetic turbulence. The probe is presently being repared but will be available
      by beginning of next year.
      We propose experiments with comparison between stationary and rotating RMP: in the latter case
      manipulator strokes should
      be syncronized in order to expolore different spatial phase of the magnetic perturbation. 
***** Previous AUG Experiment
      A long collaboration betweeen IPP/Garching,  OAW Innsbruk,  RFX Padua and DTU-Riso
      is already established for the investigation
      of electromagnetic turbulence in the SOL of AUG, based on the information provided by
      the aforementioned probe. See paper presented
      in EPS 2012-2013,  CPP 52 391 (2012), JNM 415 S869 (2011)
***** Related JET Experiments
      EFCC experiment for ELM controlled,  limited to static perturbation
      (see Experiment M13-35: ELM control and pacing physics). JET experiment can't provide
      such information using JET RCP
      because of the lack of insertable pick-up oil
***** Experiment Outline
***** Strategy
      Experiment with MP and probe has already been done during 2012 campaign.
      Reference pulse is #28861 in even configuation.
      Rotating perturbation scenario has to be developed. We suggest the contemporaneous use of
      Doppler Reflectometry for perpendicular
      velocity and electric field estimate to be compared with probe measurements.
      We also propose the possibility to operate at
      power close but below to the LH power threshold,  in order to insert the probe as close as
      possible to the separatrix and shear
      layer
***** Estimated number of Pulses
****** to achieve physical goal:Approximately 15 pulses
****** for scenario development, setup, expected failurs: 5
***** Deliverables
      In the framework of the requirements for Headline 1.2 the proposal will focus on:
      - Determine the effect of RMP mitigation on electromagnetic properties of ELM filaments, comparing
	mitigated and un-mitigated discharge and possible toroidal asymmetries due to the mode phase
      - Contribute to the analysis of electric field response, flow and momentum flux in the SOL during MP experiment

***** Experiment Scope:

      We propose to investigate electromagnetic properties of turbulent filaments in the edge/SOL regions
      in L and H mode.
      Particula goals:
      - Provide detailed information on the particle and momentum transport and the association to blob
       	filaments observed in L-mode,  ELM filaments in the H-Mode and the variation of the fluxes in the
       	transiition from L to H mode
      - Provide a detailes on the momentum transport accross LCFS in response to varying momentum input

****** Related JET Experiments
       - None (or eventually studies of L-H Transition studues M13-23 or H14-06 Fluctuations and GAMs ?)
***** Experiment Outline:
****** Strategy
       We propose an experiment with modulated NBI power,  with increasing step around the Pthr. Strokes
       of the manipulator should be syncronized in order to obtain measurements in all the 4 level of
       Input power,
       2 in L-Mode and 2 in H-Mode. The experiment will allow exploration of electromagnetic turbulence
       in the SOL
       at 4 different level of applied external torque and in two different confinement regime.
       In particular we are interested
       in determining radial propagation of the blobs from cross-correlation measurements of radially
       separated probe, and
       determination of Momentum flux as a function of external torque

** Enabling Research 2014
*** Electromagnetic filaments
**** Background and motivation
     A blob or filament is a magnetic-field aligned plasma structure which is considerably denser
     than the surrouinding plasma, localized on the perpendicular plane and with a distinctive dynamics. They
     have been observed in all the magnetic configuration with very similar feature despite the difference in
     the magnetic geometry. 
     Theory and experiments suggest these blobs exhibit a radial convective motion accros the SOL, and the
     interest is blobs dynamics is further motivated by their interaction with first wall and divertor. Indeed
     by increasing particle and heat flux into the far SOL blobs can increase interaction with limiters,  RF
     antennas and first wall [Myra, PoP 18 060501 (2011)]. It is interesting to note that, deespite their different
     genearion mechanism, blobs and Edge Localized Mode (ELM) filaments share some commonalities, being
     for example well localized in the perpendicular plane,  with an associated parallel current and with a
     convective radial velocity components somehow related to their dimension. Interestingly the role of these turbulent
     eddies in providing substantial sheared flow in the external region has been recently
     advocated as important in the process of LH transition [Xu, M.,  et al. (2012).
     Proceedings of the 24th IAEA Fusion Energy Conference, San Diego (CA), paper EX/7-2Rb, G. Tynan et al, Nuclear
     Fusion vol 53, 073053 (2013)]. Indeed since the vorticity drive provided
     by turbulent eddies gets stronger as heating power is increase, it should naturally lead to a very strong shear
     flow which can ultimately lead to an H-Mode with sufficient heating. On the other side, a foundamental aspect of
     blob studies need to be further investigated, namely the electromagnetic effects on blob-filaments. These studies,
     only recently addressed from the experimental point of view [Vianello,
     N., et al. (2011) Physical Review
     Letters, 106, 125002; Spolaore, M.et al. (2009) Physical Review Letters, 102(16), 165001] deserve additional
     effort, in particular for the implication they could have for ELM filaments. Indeed it is supposed, and
     experimentally observed, that at sufficiently high beta blobs can transport current, and the role of these current
     in ELM filaments dynamics is still a largerly open issue. On the other hand at sufficiently high beta blob can
     also carry "frozen in" magnetic field lines,  thus eventually causing line bending which could enhance the
     interaction of blobs with the first wall, without letting those blob to hit divertor plates
     [Myra, PoP 18 060501 (2011).
     Thus detailed comprehension of generation
     mechanism, dynamics and characteristic of blobs and filaments (also ELM filaments)
     is consequently a foundamental physical issue for both present and future devices

     3 Different deliverables identified for TJ-II:
     1. H-Mode
     2. High Density
     3. Magnetic topology
     It has been asked 1 session of operation where we claimed we would like to investigate both SOL and confined
     region. Carlos asked regarding the possibility to build a new less invasive probe because it claims probe seems
     too insensible to plasma condition (?). The restart of the machine is planned at the end of february

**** Abstract
     The paradigm of 2D axisymmetry in magnetically fusion devices is
     being progressively abandoned in favor of a more realistic description
     of the 3D geometry of the magnetic field. Indeed, apart from intrinsic 3D configurations
     such as stellarators  \cite{0741-3335-44-11-306}, 
     the effects of non-axisymmetric magnetic field or magnetic fields 
     ergodization are becoming a
     fundamental issue in the fusion community also in previously assumed 2D
     geometries such as tokamaks, where magnetic perturbations are used for ELMs
     control \cite{Evans:2006p2554}. Furthermore, the observation of a 
     spontaneous self organized helical state in high current regimes in Reversed
     Field Pinches (RFPs) \cite{Lorenzini:2009p4248} exhibits numerous
     analogies with the other major configurations, contributing to the
     general studies on realistic 3D magnetic field effect. 

     The 3D magnetic perturbations and their effects on toroidal
     plasmas can be classified approximately by their toroidal mode number $n$
     \cite{Callen:2011ku}: in the tokamak scheme of reference, they can be divided approximately in:
     low $n$ ($1\le q \lesssim 5$) resonant and non-resonant fields, medium $n$ mainly
     due to ripple or high $n$ due to microturbulence. This classification scheme can be applied also to RFPs although with
     different mode numbers. As a general observation the presence of non-axysimmetric magnetic field may have a
     profound influence on main plasma parameters, as rotation and transport \cite{Callen:2011ku}

     The external region of a plasma is strongly modified in presence of
     non axisymmetric magnetic perturbation. Experimental observations in
     the RFPs \cite{Vianello:2013jt} have
     revealed that a magnetic island or an edge helical ripple,  generate a three dimensional flow pattern as the result of
     ambipolar constraints \cite{Spizzo:2012hw}. This mechanism is
     likely to act independently of the configuration, and it is observed also in other
     configuration \cite{Muller:2013hq}. 
     
     Aim of the contribution is to present the 
     most recent experimental results and physical 
     interpretation of the phenomena observed in the edge region of the
     RFX-mod experiment, 
     with a strong emphasis on the effects of magnetic perturbation on the
     flow and turbulence and parallel current perturbation. 
     
     Experiments with spontaneous and induced magnetic perturbations will
     be presented in  both
     Reversed Field Pinch and low-current circular ohmic
     Tokamak discharges. Information on the edge flow are compared with the magnetic topology, 
     with emphasis on the phase relation between flow and magnetic
     field. This information is provided both for natural and stimulated
     helical discharges in RFPs, and also for tokamak operated at
     $q(a)\simeq 2$ thanks to the MHD control of the $(m, n)=(2, 1)$ mode,
     where a small amplitude (2, 1) magnetic island is found to modulate the
     plasma flow and associated shear. Emphasis will be devoted to the mutual
     interaction between macroscopic flow, modified by the magnetic
     perturbation, and small scale vortex like blobs/filaments. Their
     population and dynamic are influenced by the magnetic perturbation,
     which acts on pressure
     profile and perpendicular flow shear. All the experimental observation
     can draw a light on the transport mechanism in the presence of 3D
     magnetic perturbation also in view of the effects of RMPs in pedestal
     physics.
