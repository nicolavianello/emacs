*** Nave
 The presence of a magnetic ripple breaks the toroidal symmetry so
 that the motion of individual particles may lead to nonambipolar
 transport that can affect the plasma rotation through the
 neoclassical toroidal viscosity. During NBI magnetic ripple has an
 effect as the ripple transport of fast ions induces edge
 counterrotation in plasmas. Experiment in JET performed in Ohmic
 plasmas where CXRS angular frequency consistent with MHD propagation
 (*different from our cases*). Results is that in the core in the core
 where is naturally countercorrent, toroidal rotation becomes more
 negative whereas at the edge corotation decreases and for ripple of 1
 % it becomes counter-current. Theory suggest that toroidal field
 ripple, by breacking toroidal simmetry, induces radial particle
 diffusion which could be different for ions and electrons. This
 non-ambipolar transport gives rise to a charge separation that
 relaxes the radial electric field and the toroidal rotation toward a
 steady state where particle flux is ambipolar. In TORE SUPRA
 analogous experiment reveal the consequence of too high ripple in
 term of magnetic well.
*** Garofalo
- Esiste un neoclassical offset toroidal rotation associated with a
  Torque T_{NR}\propto (V_{\phi}-V_{\phi}^0) driven by static
  nonresonant fields. Comparable to ion diamagnetic drift but opposite direction
- Existence of offset toroidal rotation proven by looking the
  \omega_{\phi} vs torque density (zero torque --> 50 km/s)
- Modification of flow profile modifies \omega_E = E_r/RB_{\theta} and
  lead to confinement improvement consistent with microturbulence stabilization
- V_{\phi}^{0,NC} \approx (k_c/Z_ieB_{\theta})(\partial
  T_i/\partial_r) with k_c depending on collisionality
*** Callen IAEA
- Si scrive una equazione di trasporto del toroidal angular momentum
  density con diversi contributi 
  \frac{\partial L}{\partial t} = NTV + resonant FE + cl,neo,pal +
  Reynolds + momentum source
  - *Collision-induced toroidal torque* Proporzionale alla
    perturbazione normalizzata ed alla differenza fra flow toroidale e NC toroidal
    rotation offset (quest'ultimo proporzionale al gradiente di
    temperatura ionica). C'e' una costante chiamata toroidal viscosity
    frequency che dipende dal regime collisionale. The presence of 3D
    fields introduce radial drifts of the center of trapped-ion banana
    orbits with a drift velocity proportional to the normalized perturbation.

*** Spong
Troppo specifico. Tratta di DKES e PENTA. Interessante secondo me e'
la frase per cui in stellarator ions and electron loss rates are not
automatically ambipolar leading to electric field formation.
** DONE Presentation outline
CLOSED: [2011-02-04 Fri 14:50]
1. Motivation and outline
2. Core measurements: passive from BV and CV (figura del 1D impurity
   transport model). Toroidal and Poloidal rotation profile. Hints we
   have intrinsic toroidal rotation
3. Core measurements: Helical pattern determined through the
   application of non-zero reference for most internal mode with
   convective cell (fig poloidal cross section)
4. Shearing rate (location around the barrier with \omega_E \approx \gamma_{MT}) dependence on amplitude of the perturbation. Confronto
   con Nave PRL fig 2(b) (although in that case NR perturbation are
   applied and we are dealing with toroidal rotation). Different behavior core (naturally counter-current and
   becomes more negative) to edge (naturally co-rotation decreases and
   becomes even counter-current). Simmetry breaking cause non-ambipolar
   electron-ion diffusion and consequently E_r builds up to 
5. Comparison with theory MHD (but not always inconsistent) we should
   consider some other things
6. How we locate in the general momentum framework which is now aware
   of 3D effect. Angular toroidal momentum model with 3D field from Callen
   1. low n non-resonant \delta b torques (fig. garofalo)
   2. medium n ripple (richiama Nave)
   3. low n resonant \delta b torque --> plasma breaking (fig 8
      Callen) or in general Tsang (PoF 19 1976) magnetic field ripple
      lead to a non ambipolar ion flux (--> E_r)
   4. effects which comes from reynolds stress: which is divided in
      toroidal reynolds stress, convective flux and residual stress
      which convect part of the heat flux into toroidal flow (Diamond,
      Gurcan)
   5. Toroidal and poloidal rotation are linked together (see Callen)
   6. Beware this is done from a perturbed 2D equilibrium of a
      tokamak.
7. Stellarator (Spong & Helander & Ida --> we should deal with
   turbuelence and zonal flow). Rimanda al talk di Marco Gobbin
8. Edge: parallel flow inversion (rifare figura) and toroidal flow ripple
9. Edge: estimate of the dynamo pattern--> estimate of the dynamo
   field ( hints on the possibility to infer j_{\parallel} )
10. Comparison with theory: pure MHD (with no pressure and zero-velocity
    at the edge) consistent in the core but not at the edge

** Remote meeting with V.Naulin, J.J.Rasmussen and S.Costea
 - Check the modification of edge \beta in between mitigated, uneffective
   magnetic perturbation and mitigated phase
 - Ask if using high flux probe similar observation resulted on ion
   saturation current signal
 - Check if Doppler reflectometer observe a similar mode on flow
   during the mitigated phase. Beware that the different density could
   caouse a different loss of thermal particle and a consequent
   different torque
 - Check if available the spatial phase relation between the
   perturbation and the manipulator
 - It is possible to execute vacuum shots with manipulator to see if
   it is possible to reconstruct vacuum RMP perturbation?

*3D effects on plasma rotation: comparative studies in Tokamak and
Reversed Field Pinches*
RFX-mod is a flexible device which offers the valuable possibility to
operate both as a Reversed Field Pinch with plasma current up to 2MA
or as a low-current ohmic circular tokamak. Furthermore it is equipped
with a state-of-the-art system for MHD control with 192 indipendent
coils (48 toroidal x 4 poloidal position), covering the entire torus, 
indipendently powered. The system is equipped with a full set of flow
measurements, including multi-cord passive spectroscopy system, plus
edge measurements for the estimate of the various components of the
flows at the edge in low-current discharges. The probe system, which
combines electrostatic and magnetic fluctuations has been conceived in
order to provide information also on turbulence induced perpendicular
flow component, including Reynolds and Maxwell stress tensor,
convective turbulent flow measurement with an high spatial and
temporal resolution. Moreover a full toroidal array of electrostatic
pins embedded in the first wall offers the possibility to obtain the
full toroidal map of the toroidal flow at the edge.
Experimental results already obtained both in tokamak and RFPs have
demonstrated a strong correlation between natural and stimulated
non-axysimmetric magnetic field and plasma flow. Indeed MHD flow
associated to helical deformation in RFPs revealed a strong
correlation with poloidal flow [Piovesan et al]. At the edge the small
residual helical ripple modulates the edge radial electric field
through a modification of the rate of ion-to-electron diffusion rate
determining a perpendicular flow with the same helicity of the
dominant perturbation [Vianello IAEA 2012]. Also tokamak investigation 
with the application
of an $n=2$ perturbation has shown effects on the toroidal flow which
has been interpreted as a combination effect between NTV and
stochastic dominated flow. The activity proposed represents an
extension of the present partial experimental observation. Experiment
and analysis are proposed on the following topics:
 1. MP experiment in Ohmic tokamak: studies of the effects  of magnetic
    pertubation both resonant and non resonant both on the toroidal and
    poloidal components of the flow. The analysis is done in terms of
    amplitude, rotation frequency and helicity of the perturbation. Core
    measurements obtained from passive spectroscopy will be combined with
    edge information obtained from probe which will offer the possibility
    to have information both on toroidal flow and on the poloidal one,
    the latter with the added values of decomposing all the information
    related to turbulence induced perpendicual flow. Interpretation will
    be corroborated both with simple 1D momentum diffusivity equation
    plus hamiltonian code for the analysis of the edge radial electric field
2.  MP experiment in RFPs: studies of the effects of magnetic
    perturbation, both resonant and non resonant on parallel and
    perpendicular flow in RFPs. Focus will be devoted on collisionality
    dependece, and on the determination of the various components of
    the stress tensor, already measured in Multiple Helicity low
    current regime [Vianello PRL2005] at the edge by means of 
    insertable probe. Effects
    of amplitude, rotation frequency and helicity will be analyzed
    focusing the attention on the spatial distribution of the various
    quantities with respect to the magnetic field perturbation
